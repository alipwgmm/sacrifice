Main program for Pythia 8: You should make a sacrifice before you consult the Pythia.

Optionally builds against HepMC, LHAPDF (default = yes) and PHOTOS++ (default = no).  Requires the Pythia 8 library, of course.

Help on building can be obtained by

  ./configure --help

If on a machine with AFS access to Genser then the necessary libraries ^should^ be found with no further tweaking.

Usually

  ./configure <--enable-photos> <--prefix=/path/to/install> <other options>
  make
  make install
  
will do the trick.  The executable is called run-pythia.  A setup script, setupPythia.sh, will be installed in the share directory.

Help is available with

  source setupPythia.sh
  ./run-pythia --help
