2017-11-06  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Removal of boost dependency, replaced by C++11
  * Clean up old uneccessary UserHooks
  * Use zstr instead of boost for gzipping
  * Update to newest MCUtils (1.3.1) + HEPUtils
  * Default beam not set (Pythia sets pp) - allows beam to be set in cmd file, but still over-ridden on command line
  * Default beam energy set to 13 TeV
  * Tagging as 1.1.1

2016-11-17  James Monk	<jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Fix test for zlib support in pythia lib

2016-04-01  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * set_crash_on_problem now set true
  * tagging for release as 1.0.0

2014-11-26  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Fix multiple weights and CCKW-L cross section
  * Update A2-MSTW2008LO and AU2-CT10 for new Py8.2 PDF syntax
  * Add lhapdfdummy to linker only for Pythia version less than 8.2
  * Option to slim the event record (-s) is now off by default.  The option -s on the commandline now turns on the full event slimming (removes everything except final state particles)

2016-11-15  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Ignore events with 0 CKKW-L weight

2014-09-18  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Update build and params for Pythia 8.200

2014-02-26  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * change default beam energy to 8000 GeV

2014-02-03  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * improve header directory structure to include/Sacrifice include/tclap etc.
  * Download tarball of MCUtils headers and install in include if not already present there.
  * Use the downloaded MCUtils unless otherwise specified
  #increase version to 0.9.9, make tarball

2013-11-25  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Compatibility with Pythia 8.180

2013-07-29  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * PTRel_boostVetoedShower.cxx: another vetoed shower, this time implemented with a
    boost that evolves during the evtn due to recoil.  Should be identical to main31

2013-07-14  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * HepMC no longer optional.  Doesn't really make sense, since HepMC output is the whole point
  * Add option to produced gzip compressed output.  
    Option will only be present if Pythia itself was compiled with gzip support.

2013-07-10  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Optional support for MCUtils to provide reduced HepMC size through filtering

2013-07-08  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Suppress and Enhance MPI Userhooks.  Veto events with MPI above and below a threshold

2013-07-01  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * update m4 scripts for slc6 gcc 46
  * setupPythia.sh script adds LHAPATH

2013-06-19  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  *  User hook for vetoed shower using relative pT and reduced scale, a la main31

2013-02-13  James Monk	<jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Update build system to support Pythia with gzip 

2013-01-28  James Monk <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Selection of UserHooks for vetoed shower with PoWHEG
      WZVetoedShower.cxx vetoes emissions relative to the beam
      QCDVetoedShower.cxx compares each emission to each PoWHEG leg
      PoWHEGVetoedShower vetoes relative to the beam, but determines a new
      definition of the veto scale
  * The above author suggested veto schemes need testing and validating!
  * Improved UserHook library loading (local directory, SACRIFICE_LIB_PATH, install lib dir)

2013-01-24  James Monk	<jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Allow user configuration of the lcg tag for troublesome setups
	
2012-12-13  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Add support for loading user hooks on the cmd line

2012-05-21  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Initial check-in to AGILe svn repository
  * Supports Pythia 8 with HepMC, LHAPDF, PHOTOS++
  * ./configure ^should^ discover all libraries from genser, if available
  * Photos support optional (--enable-photos to turn it on)
  * ~Replicates the ATLAS setup, including PHOTOS++ wrangling 
  * Setup script installed in share: source share/setupPythia8.sh

2012-02-22  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Initial version of Pythia 8 main program + build system
